# Step 1: Use a Node.js image to build the React app
FROM node:16-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY src/ ./src
COPY public/ ./public

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use an NGINX image to serve the static files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous stage to NGINX's HTML directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom NGINX configuration (if any)
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
