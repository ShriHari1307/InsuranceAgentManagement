# Insurance Agent Management Using React

This project simplifies the management of insurance agents by implementing CRUD functionalitiesâ€”Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It provides an intuitive interface for managing agent data while integrating with a backend service for seamless interaction.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
For more information about running tests, see the section about [running tests](https://reactjs.org/docs/running-tests.html).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, refer to the [React documentation on deployment](https://reactjs.org/docs/deployment.html).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the default build configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the build dependency and copy all the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) to your project for customization.

You don't need to eject unless you require full control over the configuration. The curated setup works well for small and medium projects.

## Features

- **CRUD Functionality**: Easily create, read, update, and delete insurance agents.
- **Backend Integration**: Connects to a Spring Boot backend for data storage and management.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensures agent data is up-to-date, providing accurate information.
- **User-friendly UI**: Simple interface built with React for seamless user interaction.

## Tools and Technologies

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for managing agent data and business logic.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing insurance agent information.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and clean UI design.
- **VSCode**: Code editor used for development.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- **MySQL** installed or access to a MySQL server for data storage.
- Backend Spring Boot application up and running.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InsuranceAgentManagement.git
   cd InsuranceAgentManagement
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required packages using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React app**:
   Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Connect to the Backend**:
   - Make sure your backend Spring Boot application is running.
   - Update the API endpoints in the React app to match your backend's URL if necessary.

5. **Test the application**:
   - Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Test the functionality by adding, editing, and deleting agent information.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integrate CI/CD**: Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines for seamless deployment.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implement WebSockets for live data updates.
- **Refactor for Efficiency**: Further optimize the application for better performance and scalability.
